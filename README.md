# What It Does #
This is a store of the project files incorporated into [TSML toolkit](https://github.com/time-series-machine-learning/tsml-java) back in 2021.

# What I Learned #
This project expanded my knowledge of Machine Learning beyond the Classification with Decision Trees project for my ML module by requiring the understanding of Shapelets, and the implementation of VGEN and NSGA-II open-source libraries.

# Usage Notes #
Sadly, this code is part of a larger toolkit and can not be run by itself. It is submitted here for evaluation purposes, or for implementation into other projects if needed.
